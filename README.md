# Developing_Data_Products
This shiny app is an extended practice of the course project of Statistical Inference(Coursera class)
Quoted from the coursera page, https://class.coursera.org/statinference-030/human_grading/view/courses/975163/assessments/4/submissions
"In this project you will investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. 
The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. 
The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda.
You will investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials. Note that you will need to do a thousand simulations.
